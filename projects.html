                        <i>Hardware design to optimize polynomial multiplication for post-quantum cryptography.</i>

                            This design utilizes the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a version of the Fourier Transform
                            over a discrete polynomial ring. Two polynomials are transformed using the NTT, point-wise multiplied,
                            and then untransformed using the Inverse Number Theoretic Transform (INTT), yielding the result of polynomial
                            mulitplication over a given polynomial ring.

                            Our design is built to specifically target the CRYSTALS-Kyber Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithm.

                    <h5>Analog Scrambling using Chaotic Behavior</h5>
                    <p>
                        <i>Constructed an analog circuit to scramble audio signals using chaotic behavior
                             (without any digital encryption/processing) for secure voice communications.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project uses synchronized Chua circuits, a type of chaotic circuit. One Chua
                        Circuit modulates the input waveform, then the waveform is transmitted, and the other
                        Chua circuits removes the modulation. Due to the chaotic nature, this system is relatively
                        cryptographically secure without requiring any digital components.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project was built in NI Multisim and then constructed on breadboards for demonstration.
                        A sample demonstration can be viewed below using Falstad Circuit Simulator.

                    <h5>6502 Microprocessor</h5>

                    <p>
                        <i>Built an 8-bit computer with an W65C02S 8-bit microprocessor to experiment with
                           computer architecture and low-level programming. Using 
                           <a href="https://eater.net/6502" target="_blank">Ben Eater's 6502 Microprocessor series</a>
                        </i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 8-bit computer was powered by a W65C025 microprocessor and an AT28C256 EEPROM. In order to program
                        machine code, I built a EEPROM programmer using an Arduino NANO, supported by the VASM 6502 assembler
                        and a python script to upload the assembly using USB. There is a clock unit powering the computer using the
                        555 Timer IC, with a monostable, bistable, and astable mode. Additionally, I built a custom Arduino I/O 
                        expander using a SN4HC165 8-bit parallel-in and serial-out shift registers to 
                        monitor the 6502 microprocessor. The Arduino NANO does not have enough I/O ports for the microprocessor:
                        the I/O expander allows the Arduion to read all possible microprocessor ports using serial transfer.
                    </p>

                        The video below shows an example assembly program for an LED display, along with the machine
                        code being shown using the Arduino interface, which is possible via the custom Arduino I/O expander.
